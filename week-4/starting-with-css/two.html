    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is 
        used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. 
        It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change 
        the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of 
        XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is used along with HTML and 
        JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user 
        interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
