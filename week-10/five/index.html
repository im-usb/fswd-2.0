          One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
          the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
          "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart people I work
          with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they
          were truly feeling brutalized. But they don't." Then he paused for a
          few moments and said, almost wistfully, "And we got some amazing
          things done." Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the
          past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative
          company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple
          Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention
          every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
          surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been
          inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
          children.
