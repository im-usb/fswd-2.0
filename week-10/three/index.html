        writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976,
        was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997,
        and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's
        most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven
        industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet
        computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the
        pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry
        Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after
        their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they
        applied imagination to technology and business.
